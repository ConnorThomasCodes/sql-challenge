# sql-challenge

This repository was used to construct a database for the employees at fictional company "Pewlett Hackard". Included in the EmployeeSQL folder are multiple .csv files used to form the framework of our database. The schema and an entity-relationship diagram for our database was generated using <https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/> and the entity-relationship diagram is included as well in EmployeeDBD.

After having this basic framework, we run various SQL queries to pull desired employee information from the database.
